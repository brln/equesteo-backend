            <h4>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
            <p>When you visit the Services, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies and similar technologies work by assigning to your browser or device a unique number that has no meaning outside of Equesteo. Equesteo uses these technologies to personalize your experience and to assist in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on the Services, Equesteo saves that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session.</p>
            <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies. To manage the collection of information through cookies or other equivalent technology you can use the settings on your browser or mobile device. Equesteo is committed to providing you choices to manage your privacy and sharing. However, Equesteo does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry has not fully developed Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions. To learn more about Do Not Track signals, you can visit <a href='https://allaboutdnt.com'>https://allaboutdnt.com</a>. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Services unavailable to you. Equesteo may also use your IP address to identify you, to administer the Services and to assist in diagnosing problems with Equesteo’s servers.</p>

        <h3>How We Protect Information</h3>
        <p>We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. No system is 100% secure. The Services uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers.</p>
        <p>To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Services. Please note that if you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted.</p>
        <p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid services identification information for the Services you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. Equesteo recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the services you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than http://), along with the security symbol of your browser to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the services to which you are connected. Please check the validity of any Services you connect to using secure communications.</p>
        <section>
            <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>While Equesteo continues to work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and Equesteo cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Equesteo. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.</p>
